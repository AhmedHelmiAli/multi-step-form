# Multi-Step Form

This project implements a user-friendly multi-step form, built to meet the requirements of the Frontend Mentor Advanced Challenge. It leverages the power of React for a dynamic user interface and Tailwind CSS for clean and responsive styling.

## Features

*Segmented Approach: Breaks down complex forms into digestible steps, reducing cognitive load and enhancing user engagement.

*Dynamic Flow: Conditions dynamically alter the form's flow based on user inputs, adapting to individual needs.

*Session Tracking: Allows users to resume their form at the exact point they left off, improving user retention and satisfaction.

*Intuitive Navigation: Clear indicators and navigation options guide users through each step, ensuring they never lose their place.

*Data Persistence: Saves user input after each step, safeguarding against data loss and streamlining the submission process.

*Responsive Design: Adapts to various devices and screen sizes, ensuring accessibility and usability across platforms.

*Conditional Logic: Dynamically shows or hides fields based on previous answers, keeping the form relevant and focused.
